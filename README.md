# CONTENT BELOW HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED

## General description of this part of the course
This part of the course fo course aims to:

1. Introduce students to modelling Earth science data and the Python programming language
2. Develop basic programming skills through analysis of common equations used in the Earth sciences
3. Present some common techniques for comparing geologic data to numerical model predictions

## Course format
This course is equally divided between lectures on Mondays and computer-based laboratory exercises on Wednesdays. Monday classes will be divided into two \~45 minute lectures with a short break in the middle of class. Lectures slides will be available on Moodle on the morning prior to each lecture. Laboratory exercises will focus on applying lecture material and developing basic programming skills using the Python language. Typical exercises will involve a short introduction, followed by topical computer-based tasks. At the end of the exercises, you will be asked to submit answers to relevant questions, and possibly related plots and/or Python codes you have written/used. Students are encouraged to discuss and work together on the laboratory exercises, however the laboratory summary write-ups that you submit must be completed individually and must clearly reflect your own work.
